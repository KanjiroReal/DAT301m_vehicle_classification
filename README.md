# Vehicle Classification Project

This repository showcases a project from my DAT course during my studies, focusing on vehicle classification. The project was completed within one month.

### Workflow
The workflow involves using YOLOv8 to extract vehicle images, which are then processed by a Keras model to classify them into four categories: bus, car, truck, and motorcycle.

### Demos
- **Vietnam Demo**: Demonstrates accurate predictions on motorcycles and other vehicles in Vietnam: [Watch Demo](https://youtu.be/_5ORDvbPOC4).
- **Foreign Highway Demo**: Shows an instance where the model mistakenly classifies a truck as a car on a foreign highway: [Watch Demo](https://youtu.be/s0GQqyzams4).

Feel free to explore the code and see the results of the project. Note that the structure and organization may be a bit disorganized as this is an older project.
